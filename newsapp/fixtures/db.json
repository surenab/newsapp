attacking naval base", "description": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN  ù \r\n\r\nOne of RussiaÆs biggest oil tankers was struck by a maritime drone, the latest salvo in a Ukrainian military campaign employing unmanned vehicles to attack far-away Russian targets by air and by sea.\r\n\r\nThe Russian-flagged ship, the Sig, was hit by a drone carrying 450 kilograms (992 pounds) of TNT shortly before midnight, according to a Ukraine Security Service source. The strike created a hole in the vesselÆs engine room at the waterline on the starboard side, forcing the 11-strong crew to fight the water intake, Russian authorities said. The flooding eventually stopped.\r\n\r\nRussiaÆs Federal Agency for Marine and River Transport said no casualties were reported and that the Sig was not carrying oil when the drone crashed into ship. Ukrainian officials, however, said some crew were injured and that the tanker was carrying fuel for the Russian military.\r\n\r\nCNN has not been able to independently verify the claims.\r\n\r\nThe strike on the Sig came just hours after Ukrainian sea drones targeted a major naval base in Novorossiysk, a coastal city on the Black Sea that is home to RussiaÆs largest port by volume of cargo handled. An amphibious Russian landing ship was hit, leaving it tilting badly and sitting very low in the water.\r\n\r\nUkraine has stepped up its attacks using unmanned aerial vehicles in recent weeks, hitting targets well within Russian territory, including in Moscow. \r\n\r\n The new generation of powerful sea drones, however, could open up a new front for Kyiv in the 18-month conflict.\r\n\r\nThe weapons are fast, semi-submersible drones, and are proving very difficult to defend against. They can be easily launched at sea and at least some variants are capable of traveling several hundred miles to their targets.\r\n\r\nTheir payloads so far have proven capable of crippling large vessels.\r\n\r\n The two sea-based attacks Friday took place near the Kerch Strait, which connects the Crimean Peninsula to mainland Russia.\r\n\r\nAfter illegally annexing the peninsula in 2014, the Kremlin spent around $3.7 billion to both physically and symbolically connect Crimea to Russia by bridge. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally led a convoy over the 12-mile overpass û EuropeÆs longest û to celebrate its opening in 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Kerch Bridge has been targeted several times since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. An explosion in October killed three people and collapsed part of the roadway and Ukrainian forces attacked the bridge last month.\r\n\r\nFridayÆs assault, however, appeared to be one of the biggest to date. In addition to the attacks on the Sig and the naval base, Friday morning saw Ukrainian aerial drones target an oil storage facility in Feodosia, a town on the Crimean PeninsulaÆs south coast. Ten unmanned aerial vehicles in total were downed over Crimea, according to RussiaÆs Defense Ministry\r\n\r\nUkrainian authorities have vowed to continue targeting the bridge and ships navigating Ukrainian territorial waters, even if they are controlled by Russia. The head of the Ukrainian Security Service, Vasyl Maliuk, called such attacks ôabsolutely logical and effective.ö\r\n\r\nMaliuk said that if the Russians wanted such incidents to stop, ôthey have the only option to do so û to leave the territorial waters of Ukraine and our land.ö\r\n\r\nUkraineÆs State Hydrological Service also warned ships against using several Russian ports due to the war.\r\n\r\nUkrainian agencies, especially the Security Service, have been notably vocal about the use of these drones in the Black Sea after months of reticence.\r\n\r\nTheir use is both a moral boost and battlefield advantage, allowing Kyiv to exploit a new, domestically engineered technology at sea while its forces are are struggling to take ground in the counteroffensive on land.", "date": "2023-09-21T20:31:20.878Z", "news_type": "3", "user": 1, "image": "images/ukr_gRJB1eH.png", "view_count": 11}}, {"model": "core.news", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Central Bank of Armenia: exchange rates and prices of precious metals - 21-08-23", "description": "The Central Bank of Armenia informs ôArmenpressö that today, 21 August, USD exchange rate down by 0.25 drams to 385.88 drams.

The Lachin Corridor is the only lifeline that connects the local Armenian people to the Republic of Armenia as well as to the rest of the world. The blockade aims to create unbearable living conditions for the ethnic Armenians of the region and push them out from their homes. In recent days the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh has deteriorated further, with its people now facing the imminent threat of starvation.\r\n\r\n    As you know, since 12 December 2022, Nagorno-Karabakh people have been under siege because of the blockade of the Lachin Corridor. On 23 April 2023, the Azerbaijani government installed an official checkpoint on the end of the bridge over the Hakari River that separates Armenia and Azerbaijan. Since 15 June 2023, Azerbaijan completely banned all kinds of humanitarian transportation in both ways blatantly violating its obligation towards ensuring the safe and unhindered passage through the Lachin corridor under the Trilateral Statement of 9 November 2020.\r\n\r\n    For almost 230 days under siege, the rights of indigenous Armenian people in Nagorno-Karabakh have been systematically violated. Their lives are endangered because of frequent ceasefire breaches by the attacks of Azerbaijani armed forces, shootings in the direction of civilians, houses and schools, usually preceded by aggressive disinformation campaigns creating false narratives that Armenians are the ones violating the ceasefire. Movement of people and vehicles from and to Nagorno-Karabakh is completely banned with rare emergency exceptions for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). There is no gas, and there are rolling blackouts of electricity (for 6 hours per day). A few days ago, the operation of all the public transportation came to a halt given the lack of fuel. There is poor tele-communication and access to information, which contributes to the spread of misinformation from the Azerbaijani side. AzerbaijanÆs banning the international media from accessing Nagorno Karabakh prevents any broadcasts on the situation. Most recently, the European Federation of Journalists stated that ôit was the Azerbaijani army that prevented us from crossing, in accordance with government orders.ö\r\n\r\n    People in Nagorno-Karabakh are facing a shortage of medication, products of hygiene, clothing and access to medical services. Only the patients in a critical state are transferred by ICRC to the hospitals in Armenia to get the due treatment. The number of early-stage miscarriages has nearly tripled in the past month due to high stress among pregnant women and inability to access a balanced diet amid the blockade.\r\n\r\n    Farmers are neither able to cultivate their farmland due to shortage of fuel nor feed their cattle given the frequent shootings by the Azerbaijani military, who also damage the agricultural equipment and steal the cattle. The Sarsang reservoir - a major source of irrigation - has almost dried up, making it unable to compensate for water shortages and generate more electricity necessary for the people's survival.\r\n\r\n    ICRCÆs recent statement says: ôThe civilian population is now facing a lack of life-saving medication and essentials like hygiene products and baby formula. Fruits, vegetables, and bread are increasingly scarce and costly, while some other food items such as dairy products, sunflower oil, cereal, fish, and chicken are not available. The last time the ICRC was allowed to bring medical items and essential food items into the area was several weeks ago.ö\r\n\r\n    All the above mentioned are part of Azerbaijan's broader strategy aimed at ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is important to stress that any presence of Azerbaijani armed forces as well as checkpoints on the Lachin corridor poses an imminent threat to the security of the Armenians passing through the corridor either to or from Nagorno-Karabakh given the fear of being kidnapped, murdered, imprisoned, tortured or humiliated, as proved in the last two years. Such fears make it practically impossible for the local indigenous people to enjoy any safety, to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms, to develop in their homeland.\r\n\r\n    In December 2021, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adopted an order of provisional measures, stating that the Republic of Azerbaijan must ôtake all necessary measures to prevent the incitement and promotion of racial hatred and discrimination, including by its officials and public institutions, targeted at persons of Armenian national or ethnic origin.öIn August 2022, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) published its findings on Azerbaijan, where it confirmed AzerbaijanÆs coercive tactics and its hateful and antagonistic rhetoric towards Armenia, and stated that the Committee is ôdeeply concerned about allegations of grave human rights violations committed by the Azerbaijani military forces against prisoners of war and other protected persons of Armenian ethnic or national origin.ö\r\n    In February 2023, ICJ adopted another order demanding that Azerbaijan shall, in accordance with its obligations under CERD, take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.\r\n\r\n    On 23 July 2023, Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention issued a Red Flag Alert for genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh. On July 25, ICRC reported: ôDespite persistent efforts, we are currently unable to deliver aid via the Lachin corridor & other routes, including Aghdam. With these convoys blocked, our concern is that the humanitarian situation will further deteriorate.\"Freedom House issued a statement: ôWe urge Azerbaijan to allow @ICRC to provide vital humanitarian assistance to Nagorno Karabakh & immediately work to ensure freedom of movement by opening the Lachin corridor, guaranteeing unrestricted movement of individuals, vehicles & cargo.ö\r\n\r\n    It is crucial that the United Nations Security Council takes the responsibility to protect the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh from the ethnic cleansing as well as from genocide, which is actually underway through the forced starvation.\r\n\r\n    The Security Council shall particularly:\r\n\r\n    Pass a resolution that condemns the blockade and demands to urgently open the Lachin corridor for unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo, in line with the ICJ interim measure.\r\n\r\n    Take urgent measures to ensure international peacekeeping mandate inside Nagorno-Karabakh and Lachin corridor to ensure the security of the Armenian population beyond November 2025, i.e. the end of mandate of the Russian peacekeeping contingent, prescribed in November 10, 2020 trilateral statement, until the durable settlement of the conflict is achieved;\r\n\r\n    Request the UN Secretary General to commission a fact-finding mission to the region to assess the situation on the ground; and to appoint Secretary GeneralÆs Special Representative on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to ensure longer-term presence in the region;\r\n\r\n    Request the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Nagorno-Karabakh to assess the situation on the ground and present a comprehensive report to the UN Security Council; and to utilize all pertinent UN human rights mechanisms, including Special Advisors and Special Rapporteurs, to promptly generate reports on the human rights, humanitarian, and human security conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh.\r\n\r\n    Condemn AzerbaijanÆs policy of ethnic hatred against Armenians, which puts at risk any efforts aimed at establishment of peace and security in the region.\r\n\r\n    Signed by:\r\n    Democracy Development Foundation\r\n    Transparency International Anticorruption Center NGO\r\n    Public Journalism Club NGO\r\n    Law Development and Protection Foundation\r\n    Protection of Rights without Borders NGO\r\n    Helsinki Citizens Assembly - Vanadzor\r\n    ôFor Equal Rightsö NGO\r\n    ôPeace Dialogueö NGO\"", "date": "2023-09-21T20:30:42.504Z", "news_type": "1", "user": 1, "image": "images/Копия_UNSC.tiff", "view_count": 0}}, {"model": "core.news", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Bust of Legendary Gymnast Albert Azaryan Unveiled in Yerevan", "description": "Legendary Armenian gymnast, 93-year-old Albert Azaryan, proudly stood beside Armenian government officials, to witness the unveiling of a bust in his honor in the courtyard of a childrenÆs sports school named after him in Yerevan.\r\n\r\nAzaryan, nicknamed ôKing of the Ringsö for his prowess in the sport, is a three-time Olympic champion, four-time world, and two-time European champion.\r\n\r\nAttending the unveiling were Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sports Vahram Dumanyan, President of the Armenian National Association of Youth and Sports Gagik Tsarukyan, Deputy Minister Karen Giloyan, Chairman of the Armenian National AssemblyÆs Standing Committee on Science, Education, Culture, Diaspora, Youth and Sports Sisak Gabrielyan, representatives from Yerevan Municipality, famous athletes, and other officials.\r\n\r\n\"Many timesÆ champion of the Olympic Games, famous and respected athlete in the international arena, 93-year-old Albert Azaryan, is still with us today, energetic and proud,\" stated Dumanyan. ôYou have earned that right and deserve this honor.
